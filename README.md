# Project_3

### 1. __Topic:__ Alternative fuel stations in IL.
### 2. __Techniques:__ Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and at least one database (SQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc.): we are able to use all of them
### 3. __Main idea:__ Measure and analyze different alternative fuel stations across IL.
### 4. __Dashboard:__ map: IL map pinpointing all different fuel stations; bar chart: different types of fuel types per state/city; pie chart: different types of Fuel types stations, treemap: relationship between cities and alternative fuel type stations; user-driven interaction (e.g., menus, dropdowns: cities, textboxes: lon&lat, markers showing address)
### 5. __Dataset link:__ https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/alternative-fueling-station-locations-422f2

### The original csv file where we got our data is "alt_fuel_stations". It was cleaned into "filtered_data" using a Jupyter notebook called "cleaning data".
